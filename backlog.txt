BACKLOG:
---Refactor to req/pull console inputs for country and language, instead of hard-coding (mostly running in iPython/Jupyter, but could be handy).
---Implement open source translation library to reduce cost.
---Implement chunking and threading to speed up translation batches.
---Vectorize dataframe insert iterations, technically for loop/iterrow is an anti-pattern.
---Potentially remove intermediate list a couple steps, potentially replace in-memory lists with generators.
---Improve transparency with progress bar and @timer decorator.
---Update string %s syntax with f'' string substitution for easier readability. 
---Include DB columns list into insert query now that I'm using a DB SPROC to update/dedup instead of Python code.
---Further normalize DB table(s) for multi-language support.
