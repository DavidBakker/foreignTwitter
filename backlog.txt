BACKLOG:
---Implement open source translation library so I don't keep getting charged.
---Implement chunking and threading to speed up translation batches.
---MySQL SPROC to de-dup and sum.
---Vectorize dataframe insert iterations, technically for loop is an anti-pattern.
---Optimize code, potentially remove intermediate list in one or two steps, potentially replace in-memory lists with generators
---Improve transparency with progress bar and @timer decorator
---Further normalize DB table(s) for multi-language support
---Add requirements.txt for easier portability to vEnv
---Replace string %s with f string substitution
